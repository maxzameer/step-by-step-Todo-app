                   Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed for the React app.
                   Install Java: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for the Spring Boot app.
                   Install an IDE: Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA for Spring Boot and Visual Studio Code for React.

4. Create a new Spring Boot project

       To Create the Spring Boot Backend

        Go to Spring Initializr.
        Choose project metadata (Group, Artifact, Name, etc.).
        Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, JDBC API.
        Generate and download the project.
        Extract the downloaded ZIP and open it in your IDE.
6. Create the React Frontend

   1. Create a project directory. 
   2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in same directory.
   3. To install Create React App:
        npx create-react-app todo-app (type in terminal and Enter)
   4. Change directory into the app:
        cd todo-app (type in terminal and Enter)
